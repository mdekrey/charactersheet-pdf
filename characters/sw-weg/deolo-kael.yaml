name: Deolo Kael
player: null
species: Twi'lek
sex: null
age: 28
height: 1.8
weight: 65
physicalDescription: >-
  Orange skin. Deolo has shunned the robes of the Jedi in favor of a
  form-fitting tunic. Deolo's lightsaber is kept easy to reach under a jacket
  usually worn at the him.
background: >-
  The Jedi Order was always a part of Deolo's life. However, during the Clone
  Wars Deolo was usually found without any clones deep in the Outer Rim
  territories, chasing down a lost relic, tugging at the mysteries of the force.
  It is no real wonder, then, that Deolo was not an immediate casualty of Order
  66. Deolo's connection to the Force is still strained from the trauma of
  losing so many friends and mentors.
personality: >-
  Warm and jovial most of the time. When thoughts turn to the force, Deolo feels
  the cold strength of the Dark Side during this era, and so becomes solumn and
  sullen. Deolo feels an immense amount of guilt, but hopes the Force has a
  destiny in store.
objectives: >-
  To keep the balance of the Force from falling to the Dark Side. To unravel
  more mysteries of the ancient Jedi.
quote: >-
  Trust in the Force.
connections: >-
  Avery: Trustworthy Senator. Quinlan Vos: Master.

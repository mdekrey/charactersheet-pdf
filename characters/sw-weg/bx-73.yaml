  BX-73 appears as a standard BX-series droid with a black-and-gold paint job
  that looks slightly worn.
background: >-
  BX-73 was captured thanks to the shutdown command coinciding with Order 66.
  After a crude reprogramming by Jael, BX-73 no longer served the Confederacy,
  but needs to readjust its programming to return to its former prowess.
personality: >-
  Having confidence in one's skills requires knowing one's limits... and BX-73
  is not sure which skills remain and which must be rebuilt. Ready to put skills
  to the test, BX-73 will gain more confidence as experience is earned.

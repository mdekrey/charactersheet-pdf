template: Scoundrel Captain
name: Lare Lu
# player: null
species: Duros
# sex: M
age: 32
height: 2.0
weight: 90
physicalDescription: >-
  Lare cuts an imposing figure with blue-grey skin and red eyes. Lare dresses
  the part of a fringe world freight captain but every piece is carefully
  tailored.
background: >-
  During the Republic, Lare would offer discrete transport for senators and Jedi
  alike to Outer Rim or other territories. Earning a solid reputation meant that
  Lare was on a longer term contract with Jedi Knight Deolo Kael when Order 66
  was issued, putting Lare squarely at odds the Empire. Never wanting to turn
  down good money means being flexible, and this is just one more twist.
personality: >-
  Lare believes strongly in commitment to client confidentiality and completing
  a job once accepted... negotiating additional pay for additional services, or
  at the very least returning the client to safety.
objectives: >-
  Complete the job, grow my reputation, establish regular clients.
quote: >-
  So long as the money is good, count me in.
connections: >-
  Avery's mentor, Reo Tol: Long-term client. Jael Oden and BX-73: Crew.

  Fit, charismatic, and well-dressed. Avery may be from a lesser-known system,
  but "backwater" is not even in the neighborhood.
background: >-
  Avery was elected senator of Vandelhelm near the end of the Clone Wars as
  Vandelhelm sought protection from the Separatists' advances. Avery met Deolo
  in his first contact with the Jedi to share knowledge of ancient sites. As
  luck would have it, they were on a mission with Lare Lu when Order 66 struck,
  and Avery saw the truth of the Empire quickly.
personality: >-
  Avery's charm is palpable. Intelligent and quick-witted, Avery excels at
  talking through almost any situation, which seems to be happening more and
  more - Avery believes strongly in the good in the galaxy, of which the Empire
  seems to oppose.
objectives: >-
  To topple the Empire so the freedoms and glories of the past can be restored
  to the people of the galaxy.
